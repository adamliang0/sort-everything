# Sort Everything

This VS Code extension sorts JSON, YAML and plain text files. It can sort the selected lines of code or the entire file (if no particular lines are selected).

## Usage

By default sorting is applied when using the shortcut "Alt" + "Shift" + "L" but you can adjust that in your [Keyboard Shortcuts editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-editor). The Command ID is "bennycode.sort-everything.sortFile" / "Sort Everything".
